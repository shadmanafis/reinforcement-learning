# reinforcemnt-learning

Machine learning(ML) aims at providing techniques and methodologies for accumulating, modifying and updating knowledge in computational systems.
One of the approaches ML is reinforcement learning, which emphasizes the individuals learning through interactions with its environment, contrasting with other ML approaches that have privilege to learn from knowledgeable teacher(supervised learning) and other is to gather information by the means of clustering information(unsupervised learning). 
In reinforcement learning the learner is not told which action to take and which action will give the maximum reward by using trial-and-error method.
Reinforcement learning is a problem formulation, not a solution technique. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from experience.
